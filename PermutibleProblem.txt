Problem Statement
    	
You are given a positive integer x. Please check whether we can rearrange the digits of x (in base 10, without leading zeros) to 
produce a different number that is a multiple of x. 



Return "Possible" if this can be done and "Impossible" otherwise. Note that the return value is case-sensitive.
 
Definition
    	
Class:	Permutiple
Method:	isPossible
Parameters:	int
Returns:	String
Method signature:	String isPossible(int x)
(be sure your method is public)
    
 
Constraints
-	x will be between 1 and 1,000,000, inclusive.
 
Examples
0)	
    	
142857
Returns: "Possible"
One valid way of rearranging the digits of 142857 is to form the number 285714. This new number is a multiple of x: we have 285714 = 2 * 142857. 



Another valid way is to form the number 857142 (which is equal to 6 * 142857).
1)	
    	
14
Returns: "Impossible"
The only other number we can get by rearranging the digits of the number 14 is the number 41. As 41 is not a multiple of 14, there is no solution.
2)	
    	
1035
Returns: "Possible"
We can get 3105 = 3 * 1035.
3)	
    	
1000000
Returns: "Impossible"
4)	
    	
100035
Returns: "Possible"
5)	
    	
4
Returns: "Impossible"
